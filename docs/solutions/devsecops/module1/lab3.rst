Lab 3: (Dave) Deploy with a new waf policy 
----------------------------

Background: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

secops found a false positive on the waf policy template, they fixed it and created a new version for that policy. 
 
 
Task 1 - Update the policy you are using in 'DEV' 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Update the infrastructure as code parameters file:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

we (Dave) got the message on a new waf template, we need to deploy the new template to the DEV environment.
to do so we will edit the 'infrastructure as code' parameters file in dave's app2 repo. 
 
go to the container CLI, go to the application git folder. check which branches are there and what is the active branch. (git branch) 
you should be on the 'dev' branch. the files you see belong to the dev branch. 

.. code-block:: terminal

   cd /home/snops/f5-rs-app2
   git branch
   
Configure your information in git, this information is used by git (in this lab we use local git so it only has local meaning) 

.. code-block:: terminal

   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   
 
edit the iac_parameters.yaml file to point the deployment to the new ASM policy (linux-high-v01). then add the file to git and commit.

 - change line: waf_policy_name: "linux-high"
 - to: waf_policy_name: "linux-high-v01"

.. code-block:: terminal

   vi iac_parameters.yaml 
   git add iac_parameters.yaml
   git commit -m "changed asm policy"
   

   |dev-cmd-010|
   

Service deployment update:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- we now have an active DEV environment, the app, network and bigip shouldn't change. 
  the only change is to the SERVICE deployed on the Bigip. 

- we have a dedicated pipeline view for the Service deployment. 

- jenkins is set up to monitor the application repo. when a 'commit' is identified jenkins will start an
  automatic pipeline to deploy the service. Jenkins takes the parameters from the file and uses them to start the ansible playbooks that will push the changes to the bigip. 
  
- that way it will update the waf policy on the bigip

- go back to jenkins and open the 'f5-rs-app2-dev ' folder. choose the 'waf policy' tab ,  it takes up to 
  a minute for jenkins to start the pipeline. you should see that the tasks start to run and the pipeline finishes successfully. 


- log on to the bigip again, check which ASM policies are there and which policy is attached to the 'App2 VIP' 
  check the 'traffic learning' for the security policy and verify you no longer see the 'high ascii charachters' 


  
this concludes the tests in the 'dev' environment. 
we are now ready to push the changes to production.
