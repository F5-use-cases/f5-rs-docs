Collecting and Reporting Changes
================================

After comparing differences between sets of attributes, there are two points in a module's
execution where you may need to massage data. They are:

* Before you send the data to the API
* Before you report the data to the user

To help facilitate this difference, you can make use of one, or both, of
the ``Changes`` classes that exist in a module. This section discusses those classes in greater detail.
